        "Over 95% of Deaf children in Australia are born to hearing parents who do not know Auslan. Most families start without a ready-made sign-language environment at home, so everyday needs like mealtime, bath time, and bedtime can feel slow and frustrating. Parents often ask ‚Äúwhere do I begin?‚Äù while juggling work, siblings, and appointments.",
        "Building a language routine from scratch is possible, but it requires small, consistent steps‚Äîagreeing on a few core signs, using them across the day, and celebrating progress together. When the whole family participates, children receive more consistent input and confidence grows.",
        { type: "tip", title: "For parents", text: "You are not alone. Many families share this starting point, and every small step you take to learn signs can reduce your child‚Äôs sense of isolation." },

        "Around 72% of students with disability report being excluded from school activities such as sports days, excursions, assemblies, or clubs. For many Deaf children, being a ‚Äúminority within a minority‚Äù means classmates and staff may not automatically know how to include them.",
        "This is rarely about intent‚Äîit is usually about preparation. Clear plans for communication support, visual instructions, and peer awareness can turn ‚Äúmaybe next time‚Äù into ‚Äúyes, you can join us today‚Äù.",
        { type: "tip", title: "For parents", text: "Advocate early with your child‚Äôs teacher about accessible activities. Community events and family-led activities can also help your child feel included." },

        "Only a few hundred Auslan-certified interpreters are available nationwide, with shortages especially in regional areas. As a result, families sometimes hear ‚Äúno interpreter available‚Äù for parent-teacher meetings, medical appointments, or government services.",
        "Gaps can be reduced by planning ahead, asking about remote/online interpreting, and preparing key information visually (keywords, images, short videos). When everyone shares the same plan B, important conversations are less likely to be postponed.",
        { type: "tip", title: "For parents", text: "Plan ahead for key appointments and consider remote/online interpreting as a backup so important conversations are not delayed." },

        "Policies are improving ‚Äî for example, NSW will roll out an Auslan K‚Äì10 syllabus by 2026 ‚Äî but rollout speeds differ across states, and schools need time for teacher training and classroom resources. That means families may still experience uneven support in the short term.",
        "While systems catch up, home routines matter: daily practice of a few high-frequency signs, pairing signs with pictures or objects, and inviting siblings to sign can create meaningful change now. These habits make later school support more effective, because your child already has a foundation to build on.",
        { type: "tip", title: "For parents", text: "While policy changes unfold, start building a daily habit at home: learn 3‚Äì5 useful signs together (e.g., eat, drink, toilet, help, finish) and use them in real situations." },

                    This age pyramid shows that Auslan users span every life stage‚Äîfrom early
                    childhood to older adults. A strong base in school-age years means your child
                    can find peers and role models, while the broad upper layers indicate long-term
                    community continuity.

                    <p>
                      Ask your local Deaf society or school about age-matched playgroups or youth
                      events. Practising with same-age peers often boosts motivation.

                    Victoria and Queensland have large Auslan communities, and every state and
                    territory shows a visible presence. If you live outside major hubs, online
                    communities and remote services can help bridge the distance.

                    <p>
                      Search for state-based Deaf associations and parent groups, and ask schools or

                    (2021). Growth brings more classes, interpreters, and peer networks‚Äîmaking it a
